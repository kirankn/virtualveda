* If you do not have Python not installed on your Windows/Mac machine, you may use this website to run all your programs: [Run Python Online](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/). Paste/Type your program in the main.py window and click on the blue "Run" button. Interact with the program on the Output panel.

* We will add flowcharts and video instructions for each program on this site soon. Please keep checking.

* We shall also be improving the programs for better readability and efficiency when required. Please keep checking often.

* These programs have been made available to the students to help them gain mastery over one of the best computer languages. The more you practice, the easier it becomes to form the thoughts to compose, build and execute the programs. 

* In cases there are any queries, please contact us as described in the "Contact" page.
